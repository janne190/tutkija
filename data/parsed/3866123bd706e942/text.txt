# Computational methods for cancer driver discovery: A survey

Motivation: Uncovering the genomic causes of cancer, known as cancer driver genes, is a fundamental task in biomedical research. Cancer driver genes drive the development and progression of cancer, thus identifying cancer driver genes and their regulatory mechanism is crucial to the design of cancer treatment and intervention. Many computational methods, which take the advantages of computer science and data science, have been developed to utilise multiple types of genomic data to reveal cancer drivers and their regulatory mechanism behind cancer development and progression. Due to the complexity of the mechanistic insight of cancer genes in driving cancer and the fast development of the field, it is necessary to have a comprehensive review about the current computational methods for discovering different types of cancer drivers. Results: We survey computational methods for identifying cancer drivers from genomic data. We categorise the methods into three groups, methods for single driver identification, methods for driver module identification, and methods for identifying personalised cancer drivers. We also conduct a case study to compare the performance of the current methods. We further analyse the advantages and limitations of the current methods, and discuss the challenges and future directions of the topic. In addition, we investigate the resources for discovering and validating cancer drivers in order to provide a one-stop reference of the tools to facilitate cancer driver discovery. The ultimate goal of the paper is to help those interested in the topic to establish a solid background to carry out further research in the field.
