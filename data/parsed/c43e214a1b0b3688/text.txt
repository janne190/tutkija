# An Immune-related lncRNAs Model for Prognostic of SKCM Patients Base on Cox Regression and Coexpression Analysis

Skin Cutaneous SKCM (SKCM) is a high-risk skin cancer having an outstanding recurrence rate. The lethal rate of SKCM remains in a high level even after various therapy approaches had been applied to the patients. Currently, the prognostic is one important part of the SKCM therapy, many efforts had been made for the purpose, but it keeps as a challenging problem. In some cancer studies, the expression of lncRNA is observed to correlate with cancer, it is a promising approach to improve the prognostic therapy of SKCM. In this study, we proposed a 4 immune-related lncRNAs model for SKCM prognosis prediction, where, data on SKCM of TCGA were used, A prognostic model for SKCM was built, separately solved Survival analysis and independent prognosis problems. The method found that the ROC score of the model reached 0.749, our method was proved to have excellent performance in prognostic, and indicating 4 immune-related lncRNAs may play a unique role in the carcinogenesis of SKCM. The highlights are the calculation method is suitable for processing the selected data and Immune-related lncRNAs were creatively selected to construct the model.
