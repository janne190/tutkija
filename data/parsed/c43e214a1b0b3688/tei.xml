<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers. SKCM accounts for only 2 percent of skin cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Advances in screening and the development of anti-cancer strategies, the treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> of SKCM has improved significantly. However, SKCM still has a high recurrence rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . Research shows that tumor thickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> , the depth related to skin structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , the type of SKCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , the presence of ulceration <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> , presence of lymphatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> , presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> , the location of lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> , presence of satellite lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> , the presence of regional <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and other factors affect the prognosis of SKCM.</p><p>Although many biomarkers have been found for the prognosis of SKCM, the pathological of SKCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> is complex, so the prognosis is still a difficult problem. Now, it is necessary to construct a new risk prediction model for SKCM to improve the treatment level of SKCM patients. The expression of LncRNAs is associated with cancer. Further, immune-related lncRNAs are significantly correlated with cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> . So, it is necessary to establish an immune-related lncRNA model to predict SKCM survival.</p><p>In the post-genome era, many genome sequencing technologies have emerged <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref> . These tools provide new ideas and insights for the diagnosis and prognosis of tumors. These next-generation sequencing methods and data can help better identify clinical biomarkers for cancer. The discovery of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has dramatically changed our understanding of cancer. LncRNA expression and dysregulation are more specific to cancer type than proteincoding genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref> . Recent studies have shown that lncRNA plays an essential role in gene regulation and tumorigenesis, including proliferation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> . Considering the heterogeneity of SKCM and the complexity of non-coding RNA, a set of lncRNA biomarkers may be more accurate and stable for prognosis. Li, H et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> constructed a 7-lncRNA model based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, which may be able to predict the Overall Survival (OS) of breast cancer patients with high diagnostic accuracy. Liu, Z et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> screened eight genes (IGHA1, IGHGP, IGKV2 28, IGLL3P, IGLV3 10, AZGP1P1, LINC00472, and SLC16A6P1) by univariate cox-regression analysis, and established a prognosis model for breast cancer from TCGA.</p><p>In this study, we screened the differentially-expressed lncRNAs associated with SKCM from the TCGA database. Then, immune-related lncRNAs were screened by co-expression and developed an immune-related lncRNA model to predict the prognosis of SKCM patients. It is well known that lncRNA can directly or indirectly affect the function of proteins and cells because they are involved in the regulation of mRNA.Therefore, we further explored the role of lncRNA in the model by studying the function of lncRNA-related mRNAs. In summary, the application of lncRNA provides a deeper understanding of the prognosis of BRCA, and that may help guide treatment.</p></div>

There were 470 cases with clinical data, and 449 cases with incomplete data were excluded. A total of 472 transcriptional data samples were collected, including one healthy sample and 471 SKCM samples. The SKCM samples with incomplete prognostic information were deleted. A total of 447 SKCM samples are selected. At last, there are 360 cases for model building and 87 cases for model validation. As the data is retrieved from the TCGA database (a public database), further ethical certification does not apply to our research. Data collection and processing are in line with TCGA's data policy for personal protection.</p></div>

To better explore the role of lncRNA in the risk assessment model, the Pearson correlation-based co-expression method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref> was used to found immune-related lncRNA. According to cor &gt; 0.4 and P-value &lt; 0.001, the related immune-related lncRNA was screened for building model, and the lncRNA-related mRNA were searched using the same method and criteria.</p></div>

The lncRNA was considered significant when the p-value was &lt;0.001 in the univariate Cox-regression analysis， and then, the result was selected for multivariate Cox-regression analysis. Finally, Cox regression analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of the gene as an independent prognostic factor on the survival rate of patients. The lncRNA-based prognostic risk score was used to calculate a multivariate cox-regression model based on a linear combination of regression coefficients and its expression level <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = ∑ 𝐸𝑥𝑝 𝑖 × 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝛽 𝑖</formula><p>LncRNA was selected by optimizing the AIC value.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Derivation of the lncRNA prediction model</head><p>A total of 181 differentially expressed lncRNAs need to be further studied. First of all, we conducted a univariate Cox regression analysis to study the correlation between the differential expression of lncRNA and Overall Survival of SKCM patients. A total of 10 lncRNA was obtained by P-value &lt; 0.001, which was significantly correlated with SKCM patients. As shown in Figure1, There are ten lncRNA that meet the conditions, among which only the Hazard radio value of AC009495.2 &gt; 1, indicating that this is a high-risk lncRNA, while the rest are low-risk lncRNAs. analysis. RS = (-0.32396 × MIR155HG expression level) + (-0.33529 × AL137003.2 expression level) + (0.244771 × AC009495.2 expression level) + (-0.27961 × AC011374.2 expression level).  Figure3(B): Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis of testing data set Figure3(C): The patient's survival status</p><p>Although the risk associated with lncRNA is not high, they are still relevant in the prognosis model. These lncRNAs constitute the prognosis model of SKCM patients. In 447 patients with SKCM, four risk scores of lncRNA expression were calculated, and the median of prognosis score was used as the grouping threshold. With the median RS as the group threshold, 223 patients with a prognosis score higher than the RS threshold were divided into the high-risk group, and 224 patients with a prognosis score lower than the RS threshold were split into the low-risk group.</p><p>According to the prognostic risk model constructed by four lncRNAs, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was performed on the high-risk group and the low-risk group. It was found that the overall survival rate of the high-risk group was lower and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant(Figure3(A&amp;B)). Besides, The survival rate of the training set and the test set was similar in each year in the KM curve, indicating the model is universal. We can conclude from Figure3(C) that the higher the risk value predicted by the 4 immune-related lncRNAs model, the more patients died. Then, the AUC of the ROC curve was calculated to evaluate the prognosis of the 4 immune-related lncRNAs model. The higher the AUC is, the better the prediction performance of the model is. The AUC of the model was 0.749 in the test data set(Supplementary material 1), indicating that the prediction model was highly sensitive and specific. Besides, we conducted another set of comparative experiments. Instead of using only SKCM immune-related lncRNA, we used all SKCM-related lncRNA to construct the model, and its AUC only reached 0.688.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical correlation analysis</head><p>We plotted the ROC curve Figure4(A) of the clinical data and found that T, stage and N were most associated with risk. We carried out a clinical correlation analysis in the T on four lncRNA, and the results were shown in Figure4(B). It was found that AL137003.2 and MIR155HG were significantly correlated with the T stage. For AL137003.2, the expression is very high at T0, and the expression level from T1 to T4 is roughly the same. For MIR155HG, it can be seen that with the increase of the T phase, except that the expression of T1 and T2 is similar, the overall trend is downward. The clinical correlation analysis of the stage is shown in Figure4(C). MIR155HG was the most associated with risk, and its expression gradually decreased with the increase of stage. T(B), stage(C), and N(D).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The clinical correlation analysis of N is shown in</head><p>Surprisingly, it had the highest AUC value, but no lncRNA was significantly correlated with it. As can be seen from the figure, AC009495.2, AC011374.2, and MIR155HG are all expressed more with the increase of N, so we guess that they may just not reach the threshold, so there is no significant correlation of lncRNA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A comprehensive evaluation of predictive model performance and conventional clinical risk factors</head><p>We compared the predictive performance of the 4 immune-related lncRNAs model with traditional clinical risk factors, including age，gender，stage，T，M and N. Univariate analysis showed that the age, stage, T, N, M and prediction performance of the 4 immune-related lncRNAs model were firmly related to the prognosis(Figure5(A)). Further multivariate analysis showed that T、N and 4 immune-related lncRNAs models could be used as independent prognostic factors((Figure5(B)).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>SKCM remains one of the deadliest malignancies in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> . Due to its complex molecular and cellular heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref> , the effectiveness of existing SKCM risk prediction models is not satisfactory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref> .</p><p>Therefore, it is necessary to construct a new SKCM risk prediction model for clinical use to reduce mortality and improve the prognosis of SKCM. Clinicians should develop personalized treatment plans for SKCM patients, develop strategies for prevention and early detection of SKCM, track high-risk populations more frequently, conduct regular clinical examinations based on model predictions, and make an early diagnosis. In this study, differential expressions of lncRNA and mRNA related to SKCM were obtained by high-throughput RNA sequencing and clinical data from SKCM patients in the TCGA database. Subsequently, we extracted immune-related lncRNA. Finally, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to establish a risk model for predicting the prognosis of SKCM. Four lncRNA (MIR155HG, AL137003.2, AC011374.2, AC009495.2) were used to construct the prediction model of SKCM prognostic risk. Applying the prediction model to the TCGA SKCM data set, SKCM patients can be divided into a high-risk group and low-risk group. The AUC value of the model is 0.722, indicating that the 4 immune-related lncRNAs model has excellent survival</p><p>prediction performance. Of the four lncRNA, MIR155HG was found to be a marker of early cancer development <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> . MIR155HG is activated and upregulated by the MYB transcription factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> , leading to the downregulation of many tumor suppressor genes. The expression of lncRNA MIR155 host gene MIR155HG was significantly correlated with the infiltration level of immune cells and immune molecules, especially with the appearance of immune checkpoint molecules such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) in most cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref> .

The ROC curve can be used to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the model (AUC &gt;0.7 means the model has excellent responsiveness). The prognostic model of 4 immune-related lncRNAs established by us has the potential to predict the prognosis of SKCM patients with specificity and sensitivity. Besides, whether univariate cox-regression analysis or multivariate cox-regression analysis, the predictive effect of the 4 immune-related lncRNAs model constructed by us can evaluate the prognosis and further illustrate the evaluation value of the model. Besides, since the lncRNA used in this model have a predictive effect on the prediction of SKCM patients, also experimental studies can be carried out to explore the role of these lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of BRCA, providing new ideas and insights for treatment. However, the present study still has some limitations, and we attempted to verify the predictive performance of the 4 immune-related lncRNAs model in other large SKCM data sets. Unfortunately, due to the restrictions of SKCM clinical mutation information and patient prognosis information, we did not find a data set that met the validation requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to propose effective strategies, such as extending the follow-up time to verify the results and adopting a machine learning method to improve the accuracy of the model.</figDesc></figure>
