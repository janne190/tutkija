# A Deep Bayesian Bandits Approach for Anticancer Drug Screening : Exploration via Functional Prior

Identifying potential cancer treatments with machine learning holds great promise to precision oncology. However, anticancer drugs screening is a lengthy and cost-intensive process. To address this challenge, we formulate drug screening studies as a contextual bandit problem, in which an algorithm selects anticancer therapeutics based on contextual information about cancer cell lines while adapting its treatment strategy to maximize treatment response. We propose using a novel deep Bayesian bandits framework that uses functional prior to approximate posterior for drug response prediction based on genomic features and drug structure and leverage inherent information between actions. We empirically evaluate our method on three large-scale in-vitro pharmacogenomic datasets and show that our approach outperforms several benchmarks in identifying the optimal treatment for a given cell line.
