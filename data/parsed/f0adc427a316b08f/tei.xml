<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recent updates from International Agency for Research on Cancer reveal that cancer is a major global health concern, affecting nations worldwide and posing a huge burden on healthcare systems. Global cancer-related mortality exceeded 10.0 million in 2020, while the number of newly diagnosed cancer cases reached approximately 19.3 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. AI has transformed cancer research and treatment by leveraging its capability to detect complex patterns in medical data and provide accurate quantitative assessments of clinical conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The influence of AI is evident in various fields today, such as banking, healthcare, and transportation, and it is anticipated to continue expanding. AI has been employed in academia to create intelligent tutoring systems, computer programs designed to address the unique needs of individual students. These methods have improved learning outcomes in various subjects, including science and math. However, AI's outstanding analytical abilities have potential to profoundly transform medical research, diagnosis, and treatment. The use of big data in healthcare research offers a unique opportunity to integrate data with complex study findings, requiring significant computational expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>Healthcare institutions face a variety of complex challenges, particularly those related to biological abnormalities like cancer. AI employs computational mathematical models that mimic human brain functions. Progress in combinatorial chemistry, genomics, and proteomics has made numerous databases of biological and chemical data available. These advancements could greatly deepen our understanding of molecular biology of cancer. A better grasp of cancer biology can substantially impact the evaluation and treatment of cancer patients in clinical settings. However, clinical oncologists face a significant challenge in choosing therapeutically relevant information from extensive raw genomic data now available <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Researchers have utilized AI to identify subgroups in various cancers based on gene, mRNA, and miRNAs clusters. The mRNA expression, miRNAs expression, and DNA methylation data were integrated using stacked autoencoders and deep flexible neural forest network models to categories tumors in breast cancer, glioblastoma, and ovarian cancer into subcategories <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>By utilizing RNA transcriptomics, miRNA transcriptomics, and DNA methylation data, the analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) employed both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. This approach identified consensus driver genes linked to patient survival and delineated two distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The integration of proteomics and metabolomics data analysis effectively classified a healthy group into low-risk and high-risk subcategories in breast cancer, as revealed by multi-omics data integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Two techniques, multiple-kernel frameworks and autoencoders, have been employed to integrate multi-omics datasets for the purpose of breast cancer sub typing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. AI plays a crucial role in cancer assessment because it can recognize smaller groups of patients within larger groups based on data related to survival and prognosis. This enables the early detection of cancer and the prediction of its future course. AI was employed to categories patients into subgroups in neuroblastoma by identifying significant characteristics through the analysis of gene expression and copy number alteration data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Biomarkers for relapse in colorectal cancer were identified through a combination of copy number variation, metabolomics, miRNA expression, and gene expression. Similarly, researchers used the MRMR approach to determine significant features for predicting patient survival in ovarian cancer cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Neural networks trained with DL have also been applied to predict breast cancer survival. The SALMON survival analysis technique identifies relevant feature genes and cytobands by integrating multi-omics data with traditional cancer biomarkers using eigengene matrices of co-expression network modules <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Additionally, the predictive value of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data for various cancers was evaluated using a kernel-based ML method <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This approach has shown significant improvements when incorporating clinical parameters, with its efficacy varying by cancer type <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Like other cell types, cancer cells respond to environmental signals that influence DNA transcription, cell behavior, and overall function. However, tumor cells are just one component of the cancer development process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Owing to technological advancements, health researchers and software engineers can collaborate closely to employ multi-factor analysis to improve prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. According to reports, these analyses are significantly more precise than the actual estimates. Researchers are increasingly prioritizing the development of models that employ AI algorithms for the purpose of cancer detection and prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Currently, these strategies are being utilized to enhance the precision of survival, recurrence, and diverse cancer prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The primary emphasis of research in clinical oncology is to comprehensively comprehend the mechanisms underlying the growth of cancer cells, with the aim of gaining valuable knowledge about the molecular foundation of the disease. Furthermore, its objective was to address the rising global mortality rate attributed to cancer by employing computational biology to handle vast amounts of data from millions of pertinent cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Moreover, the integration of AI into clinical decision-making is expected to enhance the use of high-resolution imaging and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for early detection and prediction of diseases. By leveraging these advanced technologies, AI can significantly improve the accuracy and timeliness of disease diagnosis and prognosis AI can be utilized to generate novel biomarkers for the purpose of diagnosing cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The objective of AI functionality is to construct a system that is adequately trained to accurately determine if a patient will require immunotherapy. AI has capability to identify patients who require further testing, such as Whole Genome Spectroscopy, and determine the immunotherapy medicine that will have the most influence on a patient's recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The increasing utilization of AI in the medical domain, supported by verified real-world case studies, aims to effectively overcome the limitations and constraints in accurately identifying different types of cancer. Included is a thorough explanation of the framework required for AI to function as intended.</p><p>The main objective of the present study was to examine the potential application of AI in enhancing cancer prognoses, with a specific focus on top 10 most prevalent malignancies globally. A range of imaging techniques is concisely examined, alongside a diverse array of DL algorithms and models they generate. Researchers are currently examining the utilization of AI in the field of digital pathology and diagnostics to gain a better understanding of how AI could potentially influence cancer treatment in future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Role of AI in Cancer Diagnosis by using medical imaging</head><p>Imaging tests such as MRIs, CT scans, and PET scans formed the basis of the previous cancer diagnosis procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These traditional techniques may result in invasive or uncomfortable diagnostic procedures, and various healthcare professionals may have differing interpretations of the imaging data <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. AI systems, especially those utilizing DL techniques, demonstrate exceptional proficiency in interpreting medical images and identifying abnormalities that are frequently overlooked by human observers.</p><p>By leveraging extensive cancer databases, it is possible to identify individuals at high risk of developing cancer by analyzing their health characteristics, thereby enabling early screenings. AI has potential to revolutionize cancer detection. For instance, Google's DeepMind project, in collaboration with the UK's National Health Service, developed an AI system capable of outperforming human doctors in accurately detecting over 50 eye diseases using 3D scans <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Furthermore, PathAI incorporates AI into the field of pathology in order to assist in the detection of various diseases, such as cancer. It ensures comprehensive detection of all possible elements, aiding pathologists in quickly recognizing patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>AI is also revolutionizing the field of medicine by offering exceptional precision the detection of many forms of cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.

A recent study published in Academic Radiology reveals that radiologists must assess an average of one image every three to four seconds in order to manage their daily workload. The integration of AI capabilities in image processing and radiography has the potential to enhance productivity in both domains. Mammography is the predominant technique used to identify breast cancer in its early stages, with more than 200 million women undergoing this procedure annually on a global scale.</p><p>The scientists proved their statement by examining 500 randomly selected cases and comparing them to previous assessments made by six professional radiologists, concluding that the AI system outperformed the radiologists' conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Overall, the US experienced a 5.7% reduction in false-positive results, while UK as a whole observed a 1.2% decline. Additionally, there was a 9.4% decrease in false negatives in US and a 2.7% decrease in UK. The findings of this first study open the path for larger clinical studies with the potential to improve the accuracy and efficacy of cancer diagnosis utilizing digital technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>AI technology with human radiologists' assessments can be utilized to detect cancer screening tests, hence improving their precision.</p><p>People are still more capable of reasoning than AI, even if AI systems may be able to detect subtle changes in tissues that are hidden from the human eye. The ultimate goal is to determine the best strategy for combining the two to transform the radiology industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Clinical Applications of AI and Machine Learning</head><p>Clinical applications of cancer employ a diverse array of tactics and processes to effectively diagnose, treat, and manage the disease.

Alongside treating physical symptoms, palliative care and supporting services assist cancer patients live better lives by taking care of their psychological and emotional needs. Overall, new clinical applications in oncology are constantly being developed, which facilitates more effective cancer management and enhances patient care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1">Clinical Advantage of AI and Precision Oncology</head><p>Prior studies have unequivocally demonstrated the substantial benefits of AI in healthcare, with advancements occurring at an exceptionally rapid pace. For AI systems to be successfully integrated into clinical practice, they must perform at least as well as, if not better than, human intervention. In clinical settings, next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers numerous benefits for identifying prognostic or predictive biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Over the past decade, NGS has significantly advanced in terms of speed, accuracy, affordability, and efficiency. Additionally, NGS has incorporated both short-read and long-read platforms. Short reads can be employed in precision medicine to detect polymorphisms that provide clinical advantages and for screening large populations, while long reads facilitate full-length isoform sequencing. The utilization of sophisticated algorithms to analyze complex datasets will unveil new opportunities for targeted therapies in precision oncology <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. AI-driven integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, distinguishes cancer subtypes, predicts disease progression, and identifies therapeutic targets, enhancing personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment The image shows AI-based machine for analyzing multi-omics cancer patients' and healthy donors' data to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. By integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, the AI algorithm achieves several key outcomes: meeting new challenges related to identification of cancers subtypes, predicting diseases progression and survival probabilities and discovering new drug targets. This multifaceted approach integrates these advanced mathematical methods to improve the comprehension of the cancer exhaustion as well as to create the individually-targeted therapies.</p><p>Automation of the healthcare system is particularly vital in regions with little resources.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Lung Cancer Detection and AI</head><p>Lung cancer is primary cause of cancer-related fatalities on a global scale and is among the most commonly diagnosed malignancies. About 2.20 million new patients receive a lung cancer diagnosis each year <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Additionally, 75% of people with a diagnosis die within five years <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. The challenge in treating cancer has arisen due to intricate nature of cancer cells and the significant intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), which results in the development of medication resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>The progressive development of technologies in cancer research in recent decades has enabled the establishment of multiple clinical and medical imaging methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, and genomic databases through various large-scale collaborative cancer projects in recent decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. These databases assist researchers in analyzing extensive patterns of lung cancer, encompassing its diagnosis, therapy, responses, and clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Recent studies in -omics analysis, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have significantly enhanced our research methodologies and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Application of Machine learning (ML) for lung cancer early detection and supplementary diagnosis</head><p>Applying ML techniques facilitates early diagnosis and detection by analyzing medical imaging datasets. Timely identification is crucial in reducing lung cancer mortality rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. The primary method for monitoring individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer is low-dose computed tomography (CT) for chest screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. The main objective of developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems is to enhance efficiency of medical diagnostics. These systems assist clinicians in analyzing medical imaging data, providing a valuable additional perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Traditional feature-based CAD tasks consist of three phases: nodular segmentation, feature extraction and selection, and clinical judgment inference (classification). Various techniques are available for predicting the probability of cancer using ML classifiers, including logistic regression (LR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, which consider the observed textural properties of specific nodules in CT images along with the patient's clinical data.</p><p>CT images commonly provide factors such as nodule size, type, location, count, border, and emphysema information. Clinical variables include the patient's age, gender, time of specimen collection, family history of lung cancer, and smoking history, among others. However, these traits are typically based on subjective assessments and lack well-defined, comprehensive, and quantifiable descriptions of the look of the malignant nodule.</p><p>The implementation of DL based models within CAD systems has been the focus of increasing research efforts due to advancements in DL techniques, particularly CNNs. The goal is to improve system precision, reduce false positives, and decrease detection time for lung cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. The application of ML techniques for predicting lung cancer prognosis is demonstrated in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. Similar to feature-based CAD systems, these models typically follow three stages: identifying and separating nodules, extracting their features, and making conclusions based on clinical judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>Unlike traditional feature-based systems, DL-based CAD systems can accurately represent the three-dimensional structure of a nodule and independently identify and extract inherent characteristics of potentially abnormal nodules <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. For instance Tyagi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> developed a model by extracting three 3D-view feature vectors (axial, coronal, and sagittal) of the nodule from CT scans. These feature vectors were derived from OverFeat <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, a comprehensive global evaluation of nodules to define their properties using CT images has been made possible by incorporation of CNN models. Shariaty et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> developed a complementary CNN model in which shape descriptions (the "shape" feature) of the segmented nodule were obtained using a spherical harmonic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> for nodule segmentation and the texture and intensity features (the "appearance" feature) of the nodule were extracted using a DCNN based model <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Based on the addition of "shape" and "appearance" attributes, the following classification was made. Venkadesh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> employed an ensemble model comprised of two distinct models 2D-ResNet50-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> and 3D-Inception-V1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> to extract two different aspects of a lung nodule. Subsequently, these two characteristics were combined and employed as input characteristics for the classification procedure.</p><p>Applying the ensemble CNN model to raw CT scans offers several benefits, including the ability to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous nodules. By leveraging features from stateof-the-art CNN models, common ML techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NNs), and LR can be applied to clinical decision inference. Notably, some studies also utilized CNN models for conclusive clinical assessments. Mikhael et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> presented a thorough approach for systematically simulating the classification of lung cancer risk and localization tasks using only the input CT data.</p><p>Their approach to forecasting the likelihood of malignancy relied on a fusion of three CNN models: a Mask-RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> model for segmenting lung tissue, a modified U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> model for detecting cancer regions of interest (ROI), and a full-volume model derived from 3Dinflated Inception-V1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> for estimating the likelihood of cancer. Beyond their use in CT images, CNN-based models are widely used in histology imaging to assist in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Histological imaging offers a greater depth of cellular-level biological data on malignancy compared to CT imaging.</p><p>Abdul-Jabbar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> achieved this by segmenting individual cells from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained and immunohistochemistry (IHC) images using a Micro-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> model for identifying tissue boundaries and a SC-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> model for the same purpose. Although ML algorithms are widely used in CAD, the challenge lies in the fact that only a limited number of images are actually used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">AI in Lung Cancer detection and subtype Differentiation</head><p>It is challenging to implement periodic medical imaging scans, which are advised for high-risk groups, due to a high probability of false detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. That is why it is essential to develop more effective methods for early detection of lung tumours. The numerous applications of AI and ML are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. Advancements in sequencing technologies have enabled the creation of an abundance of instruments for the early detection of lung cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. However, it is crucial to precisely classify different subtypes of lung cancer in order to guide the selection of the most efficient treatment strategies. Except for targeted therapy, the management of the two most common subtypes of lung cancer, LUAD (45%) and LUSC (25%), is often done in a similar manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. Nevertheless, studies have shown that LUAD and LUSC have distinct biological characteristics, indicating that these two forms of cancer should be classified and treated as separate entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Early detection and subtype identification using a computer approach are both included in the classification job.</p><p>To ascertain the relative abundances of each cell type in the images, the segmented cells were then employed in cell type classification. This model allows for the precise differentiation of immune evasion mechanisms and differential evolution between lung LUAD and LUSC with exceptional precision.</p><p>A subsequent analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> categorized tissue as LUAD, LUSC, or normal based on H&amp;E-stained Histopathological whole-slide pictures using the Inception-V3 network <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. An important feature of this research is that the model shows the ability to predict the occurrence of somatic mutations in different driver genes of lung cancer, including STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS, and TP53, in a specific tissue. Several studies utilized transfer learning to improve the effectiveness and resilience of their novel model training procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>, considering the significant resources and complex nature of the datasets. The graphic demonstrates a full AI method for tailored lung cancer care, encompassing early identification, prediction of treatment effectiveness, and adjustment of immunotherapy protocols.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">AI in Cancer Immunotherapy: Enhancing Treatment Predictions and Personalized Approaches in lung cancer</head><p>Immunotherapy is currently a crucial component of cancer treatment. Immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which target pmd1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are used in blockade treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, have demonstrated efficacy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118]</ref>. Immunotherapy has shown significant effectiveness and is now more widely used than traditional therapies including radiation therapy, surgery, and chemotherapy. The various responses observed across people can be attributed to the distinct characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of each patient. Therefore, it is fundamental to accurately forecast whether a patient will exhibit a positive response to immunotherapy to efficiently manage cancer. The development of AI technology has made it possible to create systems that can predict how a patient will respond to immunotherapy. AI-based methods utilize signatures obtained from medical imaging and immunological sequencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>. Wiesweg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref> utilized gene expression patterns and cell type-specific genes to train an auxiliary support vector machine (SVM) classifier for RECIST categorization in response to PD-1/PD-L1 blocking therapy. Moreover, studies have investigated the utilization of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) scans and radiomics biomarkers and imaging features to educate classifiers for RECIST classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122]</ref>. Some well-known classifiers in this category include logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Evaluating tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is an essential part of assessing the response to immunotherapy.</p><p>The CIBERSORT model was refined by DeepTIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref> to determine the amount of leukocyte subsets in a tumor sample. In contrast, alternative studies utilized radiomics characteristics derived from CE-CT images and RNA sequencing data to predict the prevalence of specific T cell subsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>. In addition, a DL model was developed to identify tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in digitized pictures by including CNNs. This model employs distinct CNN modules to categorize lymphocyte infiltration and delineate necrotic segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>. ML algorithms have made significant advances to the prediction of immunotherapy response and the prognosis of neoantigens for immunotherapy. Tumor-specific peptides called neoantigens are altered and crucial for inducing antitumor-immune responses.</p><p>ML models, including NetMHC <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127]</ref> and NetMHCpan <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">129]</ref>, have been utilized to assist in the identification of immunogenic neoantigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">131]</ref> by estimating the binding ability of mutant peptides to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. The aforementioned technologies have been useful in studying the neoantigens landscape in lung cancers, making substantial contributions to the progress and improvement of immune treatments targeting neoantigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">133]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Limitation for Lung Cancer detection</head><p>Even with notable progress in the use of ML in clinical lung cancer research, there are still issues that will likely influence the direction of further studies in this area.</p><p>Accurately obtaining sensitive information from imaging data is essential for therapeutic applications. Unlike its predecessors, which used arbitrary feature extractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>, DL-based CAD systems employ CNN models <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>. Significantly, the advent of Vision Transformer (ViT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref> demonstrates potential in the analysis of imaging data, surpassing the efficiency and precision of conventional CNNs. On the other hand, DL models have shown effectiveness in other types of omics analysis. Genomics data analysis utilizes approaches such RNNs and CNNs.</p><p>In addition, to dealing with the complexity of omics data with many dimensions, autoencoders, deep generative models, and self-supervised learning models improve the process of extracting important features and reducing the number of dimensions. While it is typical to gather many kinds of information from one patient, the process of combining data from different platforms is still difficult because of the interference caused by platform noise. Various medical classification networks aid in the analysis of a diverse array of medical pictures, while the incorporation of data integration and the removal of batch effects help reduce noise in sequencing data. In spite of continuous efforts to create integrative tools, batch effects continue to be a major source of worry and full answers to the problems unique to each platform in clinical investigations are still elusive.</p><p>The implementation of medical studies is hampered by the lack of robustness and generalizability in ML models. The differences observed in various researches regarding the choice of marker genes for categorization highlight the need for markers that are both biologically meaningful and applicable across different contexts. The efficiency and strength of models may be enhanced by employing transfer learning with pre-existing models. This approach provides a practical solution to create unified and standardized DL frameworks for analyzing lung cancer data. To ensure the ongoing advancement of ML in lung cancer research, it is crucial to address these challenges.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">AI In the prognosis of Breast Cancer</head><p>One of the most common and well-researched cancers is breast cancer, which has several subtypes identified by their molecular profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>. The mortality rate for breast cancer among diagnosed women in 2022 was roughly 29.1%, resulting in 670,000 fatalities out of 2.3 million recorded cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>. Although there have been improvements in identifying and treating breast cancer, it continues to be a major issue in world health <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>.</p><p>The primary focus of efforts to prevent and manage breast cancer is on secondary prevention, which entails improving screening for those who are at a high risk. Timely identification and medical intervention for breast cancer are also crucial in implementing these measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">145]</ref>. The most significant benefit of AI in breast cancer screening is its ability to alleviate the workload of imaging specialists by efficiently identifying tumor lesions within the extensive image dataset of healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>. CADe/CADx systems serve as the basis for the advancement of AIassisted breast imaging diagnostics. Radiologists depend on CAD, which is a prominent form of ML, to aid them in identifying small tumor lesions that may otherwise be overlooked. This is accomplished through the incorporation of mathematics, statistics, image processing, and computer analysis.</p><p>However, the use of CAD identification in clinical practice is limited due to the high occurrence of false positive results and the need for biopsies <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">148]</ref>. The input picture data is used as a training set to build a model in order to improve the functioning of CAD. The system is capable of obtaining clinical data sets, standardizing the data sets using neural networks, choosing ML classification algorithms, and assessing its overall performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>. A substantial quantity of high-resolution breast examination photos is required as the training dataset for a deep learningbased AI application tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>. Furthermore, it is imperative to create a DL system that maintains uniformity across different users, devices, and modes of operation. Tumor images can be annotated either manually or using DL techniques to label the characteristics and boundaries of the lesions. Annotating images manually necessitates the proficiency and understanding of an imaging specialist. The manually designated lesions act as reference points for the automatic segmentation process.</p><p>However, it can be difficult to distinguish between normal breast tissue and tumors that have small sizes or unclear characteristics. Furthermore, endo breast is more prevalent in Asian women, namely those who are premenopausal or have undergone estrogen replacement therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> which further complicates tumor segmentation. Consequently, the lesions identified by experts do not accurately and thoroughly represent the true size and extent of the lesion, and the level of consistency in terms of being able to repeat the results is insufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">153]</ref>. Clustering-based, thresholding-based, region-based, edge-based, and other segmentation approaches are commonly used in automatic image segmentation methods. Currently, there is no widely recognized benchmark for image segmentation algorithms. DL algorithms are commonly linked with neural network algorithms.</p><p>CNN is distinguished among the most sophisticated DL algorithms because of its convolutional, nonlinear, pooling, and fully connected layers along the computation path (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). Applying AI to breast cancer screening has the ability to reduce or prevent the occurrence of errors or misinterpretations in identifying specific visible abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>. Conversely, picture interpretation systems using DL are primarily used for the secondary assessment of negative cases that are evaluated by humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">156]</ref>. Furthermore, there is a lack of randomized controlled studies that directly evaluate the accuracy of AI as an independent system for assessing breast cancer screenings with the interpretations made by radiologists. Subsequent examinations have revealed that AI systems exhibit worse accuracy compared to radiologists when it comes to interpreting data <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>. However, with the utilization of DL and training models on image data, AI still holds the potential to be employed in the future for the purpose of doing early breast cancer screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>.Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> explain the role of Al in the detection of breast cancer. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Challenges in the current detection methods and Role of AI in Breast Cancer</head><p>Medical imaging is the most effective method for identifying breast cancer, utilizing various modalities such as MRI, CT, PET, mammography, radiographic ultrasonography, and duplex ultrasound. Medical images are essential for diagnosing diseases, identifying abnormal areas, providing patient treatment, and suggesting various disorders. AI and ML may be responsible for the most recent advancements in medical image analysis. Breast cancer diagnoses are now more precise than ever before as a result of these advancements in early detection and evaluation of malignancies. Breast cancer detection methods include computed tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography, X-ray mammography, and breast temperature measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>. Typically, pathology diagnosis is considered the most reliable method for detecting breast cancer. In this process, extracted tissue is stained in the laboratory to enhance visibility in the resulting images, with hematoxylin and eosin being commonly used stains <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. There are two primary approaches for diagnosing breast cancer: genomics and histological image analysis. Histopathological images, which are microscopic photographs of breast tissue, are particularly valuable for early-stage cancer treatment. The limitations of current diagnostic methods are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. High accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors has been proven by advanced DL models, including ResNet and VGG architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">162]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of CNN designs like Inception V3, ResNet50, and VGG-19, as well as support vector machines (SVM) and fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithms, highlights the revolutionary role that AI is playing in the detection of breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">164]</ref> utilized a variety of models (DT, SVM, RF, K-NN) to reliably differentiate benign lesions from unsettling ones. Byraet al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref> employed three convolutional layers and two connected layers to categories 166 individual tumors, of which 292 were non-cancerous lumps, as breast cancer. The accuracy rate attained was 83%. Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref> proposed CNN to separate adipose tissue, epidermis, fibro glandular tissue, and 3D masses from breast ultrasound pictures. The quantitative metrics used to evaluate the effect of segmentation, such as precision, recall, and F1 scores, all exceed 80%. This demonstrates that the suggested method can correctly identify functioning tissue in a breast ultrasound image. To determine the most accurate method for classifying mammography images related to breast cancer, most researchers have utilized multiple strategies to categories ML for mammography photographs. Vijayarajeswari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref> employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to categories mammography images using features extracted from the Hough transformation, in order to determine the attributes of the mammograms.</p><p>The SVM algorithm was employed on a dataset of 95 clinical images. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully categorizes the challenging classes of mammograms; however, the accuracy is not precisely mentioned.</p><p>Hamoud et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref> applied the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) method to the DDSM and MIAS datasets in order to classify tumors as either benign or malignant. The accuracy rate has been confirmed to be 87%, with a sensitivity value of 90.47% and a specificity value of 84.84%. The MIAS dataset was analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref> using CNN architectures including Inception V3, ResNet50, VGG-19, VGG-16, and Inception-V2 ResNet. The results of the classification technique for mammography breast pictures are as follows: The 10-fold cross-validation method and the 80-20 method achieved high precision, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity. Specifically, the precision, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity for the 10-fold cross-validation method were 0.995, 97.83%, 99.13%, and 97.35% respectively. Similarly, the 80-20 method achieved a precision, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity of 0.995, 97.66%, 99.13%, and 97.35% respectively. The author obtained an accuracy of 92.84% by utilizing approaches on the DDSM dataset and incorporating transfer learning into CNN architecture.

The global incidence of cancer, specifically CRC, is on the rise. Genetic variations and environmental factors contribute to the probability of getting CRC. Furthermore, those diagnosed with colitis and Crohn's disease are inclined to get cancer, specifically CRC, as they age. Multiple academic research have revealed that diet and lifestyle choices, family history, and persistent inflammation are factors that add to the chance of developing cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Traditional Methods for the Detection of Colorectal Cancer</head><p>People over 50 are advised to have a digital rectal examination (DRE) at least once by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. If symptoms manifest, it may be necessary to do another examination <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>. The goal of DRE is to detect any abnormalities in the perianal region, the lower portion of the rectum, the anal canal, and the area between the rectum and vagina in females. Additionally, it assesses the functionality of the anal sphincter and examines the dimensions, connection, and mobility of any tumors located in the lower two-thirds of the rectum. This examination primarily focuses on the specific characteristics of colorectal cancer, such as the extent of its spread on the rectal wall, its location in respect to vital bodily structures, its mobility, and its metastasis. This information is vital for the purpose of surgical planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>.</p><p>When performing a DRE, health care providers start by inquiring about any rectal symptoms, such as tumors, bleeding, or pain. Next, they thoroughly examine the region surrounding the anus and feel the bottom portion of the rectum as well as the inside of the anal canal. This efficient and costeffective approach often requires less than one minute and is particularly effective in detecting tumors near the distal end of the rectum <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>.</p><p>FOBTs are essential for the early identification of colorectal cancer as they detect occult blood in faces. Presently, there exist three types of FOBTs, distinguished by their methods of blood detection: chemical tests, immuno-chromatography testing, and DNA-based tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref>. The guaiac-based faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) is a diagnostic test that detects the presence of haemoglobin in stool by assessing its pseudo-peroxidase activity. Although the gFOBT is beneficial, its specificity is relatively low, often requiring further tests for a correct diagnosis of colorectal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>. The 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) test using a test paper, offers a simpler approach for patients as it undergoes a color change upon reacting with certain components in the stool. While this method is designed to be easy for users, it can only identify blood that is visible on the surface of the faces.

This technique looks deeply into the liver's cellular structure to identify HCC rather than merely examining cells under a microscope. Its capacity to provide the full picture of cellular morphology-including the sizes, shapes, and configurations of cells that are indicative of HCC sets it apart. This data is not only essential for verifying the existence of a tumor, but it is also critical for establishing the tumor's levels, which in turn directs the course of treatment. Histopathological examination is another method that can be used to assess the degree of fibrosis, which is crucial in determining the optimal course of treatment. Furthermore, this method also provides security in disclosing diagnoses of liver-related disorders other than HCC (such as necrosis, steatosis, or inflammation).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Role of AI in Gastric Cancer</head><p>Cancer is a disorder that shows a correlation with age, with the typical age of cancer diagnosis being about 70 years in developed countries.</p><p>By 2030, the proportion of cancer diagnoses in individuals aged 65 and above is projected to exceed 70% <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">[281]</ref>. The increasing geriatric population will therefore significantly augment the global burden of cancer. In 2020, there were 1.089 million new instances of gastric cancer (GC) diagnosed worldwide, making it the sixth most often diagnosed cancer. It also ranked as the third greatest cause of cancer-related deaths, with 0.769 million fatalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">[282]</ref>. The median age at the time of diagnosis is 70 years. Glycogen storage disease (GC) impacts several physiological systems within the body. Helicobacter pylori infection, older age, smoking, high salt intake, and inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables are risk factors that increase the probability of developing gastric cancer. Men have a significantly higher incidence of GC compared to women, with a rate that is more than twice as high. The rates of incidence and mortality vary significantly worldwide, with the highest rates observed in East Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and South America. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[283]</ref>.</p><p>Siegel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>, report that although there is a general decrease in cancer mortality rates, including stomach cancer, the advancement in this area may face obstacles due to the rising incidence of specific types of cancer.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Second-generation narrow band imaging (2G-NBI)</head><p>Although the prognosis for gastric cancer is generally not good, if the disease is identified early, there is a significant increase in the probability of survival for five years (99.3% for mucosal cancer and 97.2% for submucosal cancer) <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">[284]</ref>. Therefore, early detection should be considered as one of the optimal approaches to improve survival rates of stomach cancer. Nevertheless, there are currently no recognized and effective screening methods available for the early detection of stomach cancer, even in regions with a high incidence of the disease such as Asia, Russia, and South America. Currently, the standard method for identifying stomach cancer is endoscopy using white light imaging (WLI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">[285]</ref>. The sensitivity of white light imaging (WLI) in detecting early gastric cancer (EGC) is inadequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">[285]</ref>. Narrow band imaging (NBI) endoscopy is an advanced optical technique that enhances the visualisation of surface features and micro vasculature more effectively than conventional WLI.

A multitude of researchers are currently trying to integrate the latest technology into the diagnosis of ESCC and devise novel techniques to address the limitations, as depicted in Table 18. Guo et al. developed a CAD system capable of rapidly identifying precancerous lesions and earlystage ESCCs. In order to train the system, a total of 3,703 NBI photos were used from 358 cases that were noncancerous. Additionally, 2,770 Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) images were included from 191 cases of early ESCC or precancerous lesions. The test dataset comprised 80 video segments obtained from 33 cases of normal oesophagus and 27 cases of precancerous or early ESCC. The dataset exhibited a sensitivity of 99.9% per frame and a specificity of 91.5% per frame. The diagnostic sensitivity for non-magnified videos was 60.8%, while for magnified videos it was 96.1% [343]. Fukuda et al. have developed an AI system that can detect ESCC in real-time. The system was trained using a dataset of 23,746 images taken from 1,544 cases of superficial ESCC and 4,587 photos of noncancerous tissues. The technique was validated using Blue Laser Imaging (BLI) and NBI video clips acquired from 144 patients. The findings demonstrated that the AI had higher sensitivity (91% for non-magnified NBI footage) compared to expert endoscopists, but had worse specificity [344]. Tajiri et al. used 25,048 photos from 1,433 superficial ESCC patients to construct an AI system focused on real-time early ESCC diagnosis; these photos were verified against NBI recordings of probable superficial ESCC.

Yuan et al. presented an AI system capable of identifying and outlining flat abnormalities in real-time during endoscopic surgeries. This system functions as a model for possible use in clinical settings to diagnose ESCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">[347]</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b366">[367]</ref> The integration of AI into early ESCC detection shows promise, although facing hurdles. It has the ability to decrease the burden of endoscopists and enhance diagnostic efficiency.</p><p>The invasiveness of endoscopic diagnosis, along with the diversity of pathological diagnosis, has generated a growing interest in the field of early gene diagnosis for EC. Xing et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b367">[368]</ref> utilized RNA transcriptome data from ESCC patients to identify distinctive secretary proteins, with the aim of constructing a diagnostic model. While the model showed a significant level of sensitivity, its ability to accurately diagnose early ESCC was considered insufficient.</p><p>In addition, Shen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">[369]</ref> examined the application of developing diagnostic models employing microRNAs and protein markers that are particularly present in the plasma of patients with ESCC. Based on their analysis, these models effectively differentiate between esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) and healthy controls. However, there has been relatively little attention given to the use of AI-assisted gene identification for identifying dysplasia associated to Barrett's esophagus (BE) and early Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (EAC). Slaby et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">[370]</ref> showed that certain microRNAs in BE tissues can distinguish between BE with dysplasia and BE without dysplasia. The early identification of ESCC poses a challenge due to the absence of initial symptoms and the necessity of a diagnosis from a specialist. AI systems that use advanced algorithms to identify ESCC using image and dynamic video data have demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity when compared to experienced endoscopists. The utilizations of real-time AI diagnostics can enhance the early identification of ESCC. Despite the existing constraints, endoscopists can benefit from a decrease in their workload and an improvement in diagnostic efficiency by integrating AI into the diagnosis of ESCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">[347]</ref>. The main objectives of future endeavours should focus on incorporating AI into healthcare workflows, validating AI models across diverse populations, and enhancing specificity. AI has the ability to drastically revolutionize the prognosis and diagnosis of ESCC, offering hope for improved outcomes in the battle against this deadly cancer. Long-term surveillance and education for healthcare professionals are additional areas where AI can be applied.</p></div>
