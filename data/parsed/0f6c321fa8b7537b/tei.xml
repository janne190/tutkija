<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used for prostate cancer screening. While the genetics of PSA levels has been studied to enhance screening accuracy, the genetic basis of PSA velocity, the rate of PSA change over time, remains unclear. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, a large, randomized study with longitudinal PSA data (15,260 cancerfree males, averaging 5.34 samples per subject) and genome-wide genotype data, provides a unique opportunity to estimate PSA velocity heritability. We developed a mixed model to jointly estimate heritability of PSA levels at age 54 and PSA velocity. To accommodate the large dataset, we implemented two efficient computational approaches: a partitioning and meta-analysis strategy using average information restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML), and a fast restricted Haseman-Elston (REHE) regression method. Simulations showed that both methods yield unbiased estimates of both heritability metrics, with AI-REML providing smaller variability in the estimation of velocity heritability than REHE. Applying AI-REML to PLCO data, we estimated heritability at 0.32 (s.e. = 0.07) for baseline PSA and 0.45 (s.e. = 0.18) for PSA velocity. These findings reveal a substantial genetic contribution to PSA velocity, supporting future genome-wide studies to identify variants affecting PSA dynamics and improve PSA-based screening.</p></div>

There has been extensive work in evaluating the clinical utility of PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Catalona et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adhyam and Gupta, 2012)</ref>. However, the effectiveness of screening strategies using PSA remains controversial. Recent approaches that have shown some promise involve incorporating genetics to improve screening efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kachuri et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhang et al., 2025)</ref>. Characterizing the heritability of PSA among individuals who do not develop prostate cancer is important, as it reflects the proportion of PSA variation attributable to genetic factors in a natural population. Most studies have estimated this heritability from a crosssectional perspective. However, PSA is a biomarker that varies over time and strongly associated with age. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the heritability at a specific age (or time point) and the heritability of rate of change in this biomarker across time. In this article, we develop novel approaches for simultaneously estimating these two components of heritability.</p><p>Even among individuals who are not diagnosed with prostate cancer, there is marked variation in both the overall level and the rate-of-change in PSA across individuals. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows serial annual PSA measurements for 12 randomly selected males from the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial who were not diagnosed with prostate cancer. This figure shows marked variation in both the initial PSA measurement as well as the rate of change of PSA over time. What fraction of the variation can be attributable to genome-wide common variants? Is the fraction for the rate-of-change different than that for a cross-sectional assessment at a particular age? New methodological approaches are needed to address these questions, even though <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhang et al. (2025)</ref> have examined these two components attributable to statistically significant variants associated with PSA.</p><p>Estimating heritability is one of central problems in human genetics and statistical methods have been developed based on twin studies and other family designs. Recently, many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate heritability explained by genome-wide common variants using individual-level genotype and phenotype data <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lango Allen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lippert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang</ref>  White Males in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial <ref type="bibr">et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Speed and Balding, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen, 2014)</ref> or summary statistics of genome-wide association studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Finucane et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Speed et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al., 2023)</ref>.

For this study, we focused on a subsample of 15, 260 male participants from the PLCO study who had no history of cancer or prostaterelated surgeries and had at least one recorded PSA measurement. This data enabled us to estimate the heritability metrics on both the baseline PSA levels and PSA velocity in a natural population.</p><p>In this article, we develop a linear mixed model to jointly estimate the heritability of PSA at both a single time point (or age) and the velocity of the trajectory across time. Several challenges arise in this estimation, including variation from ultra-high-dimensional SNP-specific random effects (nearly 7 million common variants) and implementation in population-based studies with in large sample sizes. We develop two estimation procedures with one being likelihood-based and the other moment-based focused on minimizing the sum of squared differences of products of all paired measurements. The likelihood-based approach is potentially very efficient but suffers from computational infeasibility when the total number of measurements is large. Alternatively, the method-of-moments approach is more computationally feasible, but suffers from reduced efficiency. With regard to the likelihood-based approach, we propose to first partition subjects into non-overlapping groups, analyze data in each group, and develop a novel metaanalytic approach that makes estimation possible even in large studies. This is compared with the methodof-moments approach in a wide range of situations through simulations as well as using analysis from the PLCO study.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follow. In Section 2, we first briefly review the methods for estimating heritability for quantitative traits based on cross-sectional studies and typical method for estimating the heritability using individual-level genotype and phenotype data, and then formulate a mixed modeling framework to jointly estimate heritability of PSA level at a a particular age and PSA velocity using longitudinal observations. We then developed methods for estimating the model using the AI-REML algorithm and REHE regression method. Section 3 assesses the performance of the two approaches using simulations. Section 4 estimates variance components, heritability of PSA baseline and velocity, and their 95% confidence intervals based on the longitudinal PSA levels in the PLCO study. In Section 5, we offer further discussion on the findings and implications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Estimating Heritability in Cross-Sectional Studies</head><p>For a quantitative trait, heritability quantifies the proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals. Two types of heritability are often used in the genetics field:</p><p>H 2 , the broad sense heritability that measures the full contribution of genetics to the trait, and h 2 , the narrow sense heritability that measures the total additive genetic effects. The analysis of narrow sense heritability can be based on the following model</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y i = µ + g i + ϵ i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where y i denotes the phenotypic value, µ denotes the mean of phenotypic values, g i = P p=1 α p z ip denotes the total additive genetic effects, z ip represents the genotypic values standardized with mean zero and variance one across subjects, α p ∼ N(0, σ 2 α ) is random effect for SNP p, and ϵ i denotes the residue. Under</p><p>the assumption that g i and ϵ i are independent, we have Var(</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y i ) = σ 2 g + σ 2 ϵ with σ 2 g = Var(g i ) = P σ 2 α and σ 2 ϵ = Var(ϵ i ).</formula><p>The narrow sense heritability can be defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Visscher et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h 2 = σ 2 g /(σ 2 g + σ 2 ϵ )</formula><p>Estimating h 2 relies on the following equation cor(y i , y k ) = h 2 G ik after we standardize y = (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y N ) ⊤ such that the variance of the phenotype is 1, where G ik = P p=1 z ip z kp /P is the genetic correlation between two subjects. This equation leads to two types of methods for estimating h 2 : restricted maximum likelihood (REML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yang et al., 2010)</ref> and phenotype correlation-genotype correlation (PCGC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lynch and Walsh, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Golan et al., 2014)</ref>. Since we will extend both methods for estimating variance components in longitudinal settings, we here briefly describe the two methods. The PCGC method regresses the empirical phenotypic correlation y i y k onto genetic correlations G ik with the slope unbiasedly estimating h 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lynch and Walsh, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Golan et al., 2014)</ref>, similar to the Haseman-Elston (HE) regression in the genetic literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Haseman and Elston, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen, 2014)</ref>. This method has been further extended to estimate multiple variance components and is referred to as the Restricted Haseman-Elston (REHE) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Yue et al., 2021)</ref>. The confidence interval of the estimate is obtained by parametric bootstrapping. This approach, while simple and easy to implement, loses efficiency compared to those methods based on the full likelihood.</p><p>We then review the REML method. Let Z = (z ip ) N ×P denote the genetic information matrix for N subjects and P common variants. Let G = ZZ ⊤ /P be the N × N genetic correlation matrix. Let θ = (σ 2 g , σ 2 ϵ ) ⊤ . The marginal distribution y|Z, θ, β ∼ N(Aβ, V ), where A and β are the design matrix and coefficients for fixed effects, respectively, V = Cov(y|Z, θ) = σ 2 g G + σ 2 ϵ I N and I N is a N × N identity matrix. The restricted log likelihood can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ℓ REM L (θ|y, Z) = - 1 2 y ⊤ Ry + log det(V ) + log det(A ⊤ V -1 A) + constant, where R = V -1 -V -1 A(A ⊤ V -1 A) -1 A ⊤ V -1</formula><p>represents the matrix transforming observed response into residuals. The average information REML (AI-REML) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Johnson and Thompson, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gilmour et al., 1995)</ref> is easier to implement, computationally efficient, and numerically stable to unbiasedly estimate variance components and has been widely used for fitting mixed model, including estimating heritability in genetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yang et al., 2010)</ref> . In each iteration, we calculate the gradient vector DL θ (θ) with</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∂ℓ REM L ∂θ s = - 1 2 tr R ∂V ∂θ s -y ⊤ R ∂V ∂θ s Ry ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and AI θ (θ), the average of the observed and expected information matrix of θ, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">AI θ (θ) s,k = 1 2 ( ∂ 2 ℓ REM L ∂θ s θ k + E[ ∂ 2 ℓ REM L ∂θ s θ k ]) = - 1 2 y ⊤ R ∂V ∂θ s R ∂V ∂θ k Ry ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ∂V /∂θ 1 = G and ∂V /∂θ 2 = I N . Of note, the average information matrix is much easier to calculate. The AI-REML method updates θ at iteration h + 1 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">θ(h+1) = θ(h) -[AI θ ( θ(h) )] -1 DL θ ( θ(h) ), (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where h is iterate number and each θ s and θ k are the sth and kth element in θ.</p><p>The covariance matrix for θ is obtained as -AI θ ( θ) -1 after convergence and the variance of ĥ2 can be derived by the Delta method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lynch and Walsh, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lehmann and Casella, 2006)</ref>. Of note, V can be expressed as a linear combination of multiple variance components, a necessary condition for the AI-REML algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Johnson and Thompson, 1995)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heritability in Longitudinal Studies</head><p>Consider a longitudinal study with N subjects, each of which has n i observations.

The study has P common variants with genotypic values z ip standardized to have mean zero and variance one across subjects. We propose the following mixed effect model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">y ij = β 0 + L l=1 β l m (l) ij + g i + g * i t ij + b i0 + b i1 t ij + e ij ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where b i0 ∼ N(0, σ 2 b0 ) is subject-specific random effects on the intercept, b i1 ∼ N(0, σ 2 b1 ) is the random effect on the slope, g i = P p=1 α p z ip denotes baseline random genetic effects, g * i = P p=1 η p z ip denotes the random effects for the slope, and residual e ij ∼ N(0, σ 2 e ). We assume that genotype random effects α p ∼ N(0, σ 2 α ) and η p ∼ (0, σ 2 η ), and they are mutually independent, and are independent of the residuals.</p><p>We have σ 2 g = Var(g i ) = P σ 2 α and σ 2 g * = Var(g * i ) = P σ 2 η .

The metric λ 1 is different from what is usually assessed for heritability at a particular time point in cross-sectional studies.</p><p>In a cross-sectional design, we cannot distinguish between individual-specific and residual variation, resulting in heritability defined as σ 2 g /(σ 2 g + σ 2 b0 + σ 2 e ) in our notation. Our definition for λ 1 uses the longitudinal data structure to assess the heritability at a particular time point treating the within-individual variation as measurement error.</p></div>

An approach to address the challenge is to evenly divide the subjects into M non-overlapping groups and then apply the AI-REML algorithm for each group to estimate θm (and ξm ). The final estimate can then be obtained by appropriately combining θm (and ξm ), using methods such as a simple average or a fixed effect meta-analysis. While this strategy is conceptually straightforward, we have two comments regarding its implementation. First, this approach may lose efficiency because it does not utilize crossgroup information. To minimize information loss, we recommend reducing the number of groups as much as possible while maintaining computational feasibility. Second, all elements of θ and ξ are constrained to be positive. Failing to account for this left truncation could result in biased estimates for θ and ξ, as we will show in simulations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Simulation Studies</head><p>We conducted extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed AI-REML algorithm and the REHE method, with particular focus on assessing bias and precision for estimating two heritability metrics (λ 1 and λ 2 ). Specifically, we examined the influence of several key factors, including sample size, the number of longitudinal measurements per subject, and the inclusion of non-causal genetic common variants (i.e., 10, 000 causal variants and 6, 938, 674 variants unrelated to the phenotype). To make the simulations realistic and tailored for the PSA analysis in the PLCO study, we used the genotype data from the PLCO study to simulate genetic effects g i for the baseline and g * i for the velocity.</p><p>The simulation is done in the following steps. First, we randomly selected 10, 000 genetic variants as causal. Second, for each subject, we generated independent random genotypic effects α p for the baseline and η p for the velocity for the 10, 000 causal variants, and calculated g i and g * i accordingly. After simulating g i and g * i , we simulated the ages of selection for each subject and generated the corresponding phenotypic values in Model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">15</ref>). Since the study entry age ranged from 54 to 74 years in the PLCO study and each subject had J repeated measurements in the simulation settings where J was set to be 6 or 10, the screening ages t ij were simulated within the range of 54 to 84 and normalized to (t ij -54)/30 to ensure numerical stability. Coefficients of fixed effects were set as (β 0 , β 1 ) ⊤ = (-0.2118, 0.8415) ⊤ , similar to the estimates from the PSA analysis in the PLCO study.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides parameter settings for Scenarios I, II and III, including the variance components and the corresponding heritability metrics for the intercept and velocity effects. In Scenario I, the residual error is substantially smaller than all other sources of variation including for both genetic (σ 2 g and σ 2 g * )</p><p>and extraneous individual-specific (σ 2 b0 and σ 2 b1 ) components. In this scenario, all non-residual variance components are equal and both heritability metrics (λ 1 and λ 2 ) are 0.5. Scenario II emphasizes stronger heritability of the phenotype at 54 years old (λ 1 = 0.8) and weaker heritability for the velocity (λ 2 = 0.2), while Scenario III reverses this pattern to favor higher heritability of the phenotypic velocity (λ 2 = 0.8).</p><p>These settings were chosen to evaluate the robustness and sensitivity of the AI-REML algorithm and the REHE method under situations where the heritability metrics are centered at 0.5, and near the boundary values of 0 or 1. To assess the impact of those aforementioned key factors, we considered a range of simulation settings with either N = 2, 000 or 15, 260 subjects, each having J longitudinal observations where J was set to be 6 or 10. The number of genetic variants used to estimate variance components and the two heritability metrics were set to be either P = 10, 000 (causal variants only) or P = 6, 948, 674 (including both causal and noncausal variants). Each simulation setting was evaluated based on 1, 000 repetitions. Notably, for the AI-REML algorithm, simulations were conducted for N = 2, 000, where partitioning was not required and for N = 15, 260 where the datasets were evenly divided into seven subsamples to accommodate computational constraints.</p><p>Simulation results are presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, including both the mean and median of the estimates across simulated realizations. For the proposed AI-REML algorithm using truncation-adjusted metaanalysis in large-scale studies (N = 15, 260), the estimation of both two heritability metrics is unbiased under all situations considered. Interestingly, estimates of both heritability metrics remain unbiased even when all available variants (P = 6, 948, 674), rather than all true causal variants, are included in the model, where the Gaussian effect size assumption for α p and η p is violated (only 10, 000 causal variant effects simulated from Gaussian distributions and the remaining 6, 938, 674 non-causal variant effects set to zero). These findings are consistent with previous simulation studies in cross-sectional settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yang et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Yang et al., , 2011) )</ref> and are further supported by theoretical results from asymptotic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jiang et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, we compared the results of truncation-adjusted meta-analysis (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) with those of the simple averaging method (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S5</ref> of Supplementary Material D) for combining the partitionspecific estimates, using the AI-REML algorithm for N = 15, 260. For estimating λ 1 , both methods yielded nearly unbiased estimates. This is because the partition-specific estimates of λ 1 are typically wellestimated when the sample size per subgroup is large enough, resulting in rarely approaching either the boundary values of 0 or 1. In contrast, the estimation of λ 2 exhibits substantially greater variability under limited number of measurements per subject, resulting in partition-specific estimates more frequently hitting the boundaries. When λ 2 is 0.5, both methods remain nearly unbiased due to the symmetric distribution and equal likelihood of reaching the lower or upper bound. However, when λ 2 deviates from 0.5, the simple averaging method performed poorly for estimating λ 2 , particularly under the cases with P = 6, 948, 674 and J = 6 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S5</ref> of Supplementary Material D), highlighting the necessity of truncation-adjusted meta-analysis in such cases. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> of Supplementary Material D, these cases corresponds to the situation where partition-specific estimates of λ 2 have a high likelihood of hitting one of the boundary values (0 or 1), with a different (and asymmetric) probability of reaching each boundary. In contrast, when the number of repeated measures is increased to J = 10, or when only the causal variants are included (P = 10, 000), the simple averaging method performs well for estimating λ 2</p><p>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S5</ref> of Supplementary Material D), as the variability of the partition-specific estimates is reduced, leading to these estimates rarely reaching the boundary values.</p><p>For the AI-REML algorithm with a smaller sample size (N = 2, 000), there is no bias for estimating λ 1 , while estimation of λ 2 appears biased when its true value deviates from 0.5, the number of measurements is small (J = 6), and all available variants are incorporated (P = 6, 948, 674). However, when we define bias with respect to the median rather than the mean, there is no bias in these cases (due to many of the λ 2 from 1,000 repetitions being either left-truncated at zero or right-truncated at 1).</p><p>Unlike AI-REML, which achieves unbiased estimation for two heritability components when N = 15, 260, REHE provides biased estimation of λ 2 when its true value deviates from 0.5 and non-causal variants are included <ref type="bibr">(P = 6, 948, 674)</ref>. This bias is eliminated or substantially reduced when bias is based on using the median rather than the mean to account for truncation.</p><p>The results indicate that for both sample sizes (N ) and differing number of follow-up measurements per subject (J), AI-REML achieves smaller variability in estimating heritability components than REHE.</p><p>This finding is expected since AI-REML, without partitioning when N = 2, 000, utilizes the full likelihood information, whereas REHE relies solely on pairwise information. For the larger sample sizes (N = 15, 260), where partitioning is necessary for implementing AI-REML, the fact that the average Hessianbased standard errors (SE), empirical standard errors (Emp SE), and scaled median absolute median (MAD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rousseeuw and Croux, 1993)</ref> are similar for differing number of J and P demonstrates the good statistical properties of the proposed truncation-adjusted meta-analysis approach.

In the PLCO genetic data, both the dosage and allele frequency (AF) for each SNP are based on the reference allele. The genetic relationship matrix G was constructed by the standardized genotype values, defined as z ip = (x ip -AF p )/ 2AF p (1 -AF p ) where x ip is the number of copies of the reference allele for the pth SNP of the ith individual, and AF p is the frequency of the reference allele for the pth SNP. and exclusion, and culminating in the retained sample used for the longitudinal PSA analysis in the PLCO study We propose a longitudinal model for the serial PSA measurements that incorporates screening age and joint genetic effects derived from genome-wide genetic variants to describe the trajectories among the 15,260 unaffected males:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">y ij = β 0 + β 1 t ij + g i + g * i t ij + b i0 + b i1 t ij + e ij , g i = P p=1 α p z ip , g * i = P p=1 η p z ip .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Recognizing the skewness of measurements of PSA level in this population, we applied a log transformation to normalize the distribution and meet the normality assumption for the response in Model (15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zhang et al., 2025)</ref>. A small subset of participants (9 out of 15, 260) were recorded zero PSA values. To justment since there is only a lower bound at zero and no upper bound. For the heritability metrics (λ 1 and λ 2 ), those of which is bounded by 0 and 1, we used a doubly truncated adjustment. The results indicate substantial heritability for both the intercept and slope, estimated at 0.31 (SE = 0.07) and 0.45 (SE = 0.18), respectively. As a sensitivity analysis, we performed the analysis by partitioning the population into seven groups and obtained similar results (Supplementary Material D). As seen in the simulation results, standard errors for estimating slope heritability are substantially larger than those for the intercept, demonstrating the difficulty in making inference on the genetic influences for velocity. In the PLCO Study, we had an average number of follow-up measurements across participants of 5.34. With additional follow-up measurements, we would certainly decrease the standard error for λ 2 . In the simulations, we showed that there was a substantial decrease in the standard errors for λ 2 when we increased the number of follow-up measurements per subject from 6 to 10 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Moreover, the two estimated heritability metrics, combined from partition-specific estimates using the simple averaging method or fixed-effect meta-analysis, were comparable to those derived from the truncation-adjusted meta-analysis (Supplementary Material E). This consistency is expected, as our simulation studies indicated minimal bias in estimating λ 2 when this heritability metric is approximately 0.50.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the results when we applied the REHE method to the PLCO Study data, we find that the estimated ratios of genetic contributions to the baseline PSA levels and the rate of change in PSA level are 0.26 (SE = 0.06) and 0.48 (SE = 0.37), respectively. A comparison of the AI-REML algorithm and REHE method shows similar estimates of heritability metrics and standard errors for heritability on the intercept (λ 1 ), but notable differences in the standard errors for velocity heritability (λ 2 ). This observation is consistent with findings from the simulation studies, where AI-REML, particularly when combined with truncation-adjusted meta-analysis, demonstrated superior performance over REHE, especially in estimating the velocity heritability. Overall, based on the AI-REML results for the longitudinal PSA data from the PLCO study, the heritability of baseline PSA was estimated at 0.32 (SE = 0.07) and the heritability of PSA velocity at 0.45 (SE = 0.18), suggesting a substantial genetic contribution to PSA velocity. This finding highlights the potential for genome-wide association studies of PSA velocity and SE denotes the estimated standard error, derived from estimated Fisher information. For the combined estimates based on five parts, meta-analysis was performed for each of variance components (σ 2 g , σ 2 g * , σ 2 b0 , σ 2 b1 and σ 2 e ) using left-truncated Gaussian distribution, while heritability metrics (λ1 and λ2) were analyzed using doubly truncated Gaussian distributions.</p><p>further genetically adjusted PSA velocity to enhance the efficacy of PSA screening for the early detection of (aggressive) prostate cancer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we introduce a mixed modeling framework designed to assess the genetic contributions to a longitudinal phenotype. This framework separately estimates the overall genetic contributions to both the intercept and slope components, enabling an examination of static and dynamic aspects of a phenotypic trait. We proposed two approaches, AI-REML and REHE, that can accommodate large sample sizes, making them suitable for typical population-based studies. These methods build upon earlier approaches applied to cross-sectional phenotypes where only a single individual-specific genetic effect needs to be incorporated for characterizing the heritability <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yang et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Yang et al., , 2011))</ref>.</p><p>For both small (N = 2, 000) and larger sample sizes (N = 15, 260), AI-REML algorithm outperforms REHE method in our simulation studies. This was particularly pronounced in estimating λ 2 as compared with λ 1 . For smaller sample sizes where AI-REML can be directly applied without partitioning, the reduced standard errors for AI-REML over REHE is easily explained since the former maximizes the full likelihood while the latter is a method-of-moments estimator. In the PLCO analysis and in simulations with the larger sample size of N = 15, 260, AI-REML still outperforms REHE in most situations. This is interesting since partitioning is required for AI-REML, and the required meta-analysis approach does not use cross-partition information. REHE, however, uses pairwise information across the entire large dataset.</p><p>For very large longitudinal studies (larger than the PLCO study), REHE may outperform AI-REML. This would be consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhou (2017)</ref> who demonstrated that a moment-based estimation method, HE, outperformed partitioned AI-REML for cross-sectional studies with very large sample sizes.</p><p>Incorporating genetic variation into the rate-of-change in a longitudinal phenotype poses significant methodological challenges. First, applying the AI-REML or REHE to data with large sample sizes is difficult since the dimensionality increases with the total number of measurements and not just the number of individuals. A direct implementation of AI-REML is prohibitive for large-scale studies since inverting a covariance matrix whose dimension of the total number of measurements is required. In large studies, we proposed a convenient way to conduct the AI-REML algorithm by evenly splitting the population into multiple groups and then combining estimates across these groups. Particularly for estimating the slope heritability (λ 2 ), we proposed a truncation adjustment that accounts for group-specific estimates on the boundary. In the motivating example, estimates using this adjustment were similar to estimates obtained by simply averaging estimates (some on the boundary) across groups. Our simulations showed that the simple averaging method performed well when the true value of λ 2 is 0.50, since group specific estimates were as likely to be 0 as to be 1. In contrast, simulations showed that the naive approach of simply averaging the estimates performed poorly when λ 2 was closer to either 0 or 1.</p><p>Through analyses of PLCO Study data and simulation studies, we found that a large number of longitudinal measurements is needed for estimating the slope heritability well. For example, in our application where the average number of serial measurements per individual is 5.34, the standard error for λ2 is substantially larger than that for λ1 for the AI-REML algorithm (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). In fact, a 95% confidence interval for λ2 ranges from 0.09 to 0.80, making precise inference on λ 2 difficult in this analysis. Simulation results suggested that there is substantially reduced variability for estimating λ 2 when J = 10 as compared with J = 6.</p><p>With the proposed methodologies, we are able to estimate the heritability of both a longitudinal biomarker at a particular time point and the velocity of the phenotype. Our method allows for the estimation of heritability at any age (t). However, given our formulation, which decomposes overall genetic effects into baseline and velocity components, the resulting time-dependent heritability follows a quadratic pattern with time. If obtaining a time-dependent assessment of heritability is the purpose, a more flexible approach could be developed where non-parametric regression methods tailored to high-dimensional data structures may be applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hastie and Tibshirani, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">S ¸entürk and Müller, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hoover et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>dependent genetic effects as g i (t) = P p=1 α p (t)z ip , where the high-dimensional random functions α p (t)'s follow a stochastic processes with mean zero. This is an area for future research.</p><p>We conclude that the proposed AI-REML algorithm combined with truncation-adjusted meta-analysis perform well in estimating the heritability of static and dynamic aspects of longitudinal phenotypes in large population studies. Several alternative REML-based approaches that may offer improved efficiency warrant exploration in future research. First, directly maximizing the restricted log likelihood without partitioning would be a possible if we could invert very high dimensional covariance matrices corresponding to our model framework, where all measurements are correlated with each other (within and between individuals). However, this poses a significant numerical challenge. Second, a straightforward two-stage approach could be considered, in which individual-specific coefficients for intercepts and slopes are estimated in the first stage, followed by the estimation of velocity heritability based on REML method in the second stage. Although this two-stage approach may be feasible under balanced data structures, it may be problematic in settings with highly imbalanced designs. Third, a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) REML algorithm could be developed by extending methods previously proposed for heritability analysis in cross-sectional studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rousseeuw and Croux, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Loh et al., 2015a,b)</ref>) to the longitudinal setting.

We randomly partition the population into five groups, each containing 3, 052 males, and then apply the AI-REML algorithm on each subsample. Variance components and the two derived heritability metrics are separately estimated for each partition. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> presents the partition-specific estimates from the AI-REML algorithm (columns 2-6); note that in some cases, these estimates are at the boundary of the parameter space (this only occurs when estimating the variance components and heritability related to slope).
