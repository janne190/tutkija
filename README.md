# Tutkija

Tutkija is a starter template for a multi-agent literature review workflow. The repository documents shared working practices, developer tooling and a phased delivery plan before feature work starts.

## Documentation
- `docs/pelisaannot.md` contains the team working agreement plus DoR/DoD
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` summarises the system on a single page
- `docs/mittarit.md` lists the metrics and guard-rails
- `docs/adr/` tracks architectural decisions

## Quick start
```powershell
# set up the environment
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uv pip install -e .

# configuration smoke test
la hello

# OpenAlex metadata search (tries language fallbacks automatically)
la search "genomic screening" --out data\cache\search.parquet
la search --topic "genominen seulonta sy\u00f6v\u00e4ss\u00e4" --lang auto --out data\cache\search.parquet
```
> Windows: wrap the topic in quotes so UTF-8 characters survive.

## Delivery phases
- Phase 0: foundation, CLI smoke test (`la hello`)
- Phase 1: search + metadata with golden snapshot tests and metrics
- Phase 2: screening, PDF handling and automated reporting

Always run `make setup` (or the equivalent commands) before your first change and verify the pre-commit hooks via `pre-commit run --all-files`.

## Release
Tag versions as `vX.Y.Z`, for example `v0.0.1`. The Release workflow builds artifacts and publishes a GitHub Release automatically.
